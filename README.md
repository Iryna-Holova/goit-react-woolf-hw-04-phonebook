# Contact Book

Take your solution to the assignment from the
[previous homework](https://github.com/Iryna-Holova/goit-react-woolf-hw-02-phonebook)
and add storage phonebook contacts to `localStorage`. Use lifecycle methods.

- When you add and delete a contact, the contacts are stored in the local
  storage.
- When the application is loaded, contacts, if any, are read from local storage
  and are written to the state.
